I just bought a new MacBook since I managed to break my old one while travelling in Taiwan. This is a good chance to review all the apps I need on my system. The essential things I installed right away to get started were:

- Homebrew, the de-facto standard package manager for macOS.
- Xcode, for iOS/macOS app development.
- Dash, an offline documentation viewer/browser.
- Firefox, always good to have another browser besides Safari on your system. Some people prefer Chrome.
- MacTeX, a LaTeX distribution for macOS.
- VirtualBoxÂ to run VMs, mostly for development. Some people prefer VMware.

Additionally, I also installed a couple of apps that are not strictly necessary, but I still use them occasionally.

- Affinity Photo
- Git Up
- VPN

Instead of using the awesome Shimo app, I opted for using the native IKEv2 support in macOS to set up some of my VPNs. It is always useful to have a few in case you are forced to use a questionable public WiFi. I probably will need to set up Shimo anyways to access my university's VPN at some point in time.

Homebrew packages

Out-of-the box, macOS has a bunch of great things already, but some of the tools it ships with are out-of-date.

- git
- vim
- tmux
- ruby
- rust

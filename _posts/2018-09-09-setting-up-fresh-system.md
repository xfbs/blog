I just bought a new MacBook since I managed to break my old one while travelling in Taiwan. This is a good chance to review all the apps I need on my system. The essential things I installed right away to get started were:

- [Homebrew][], the de-facto standard package manager for macOS.
- [Xcode][], for iOS/macOS app development.
- [Dash][], an offline documentation viewer/browser.
- [Firefox][], always good to have another browser besides Safari on your system. Some people prefer Chrome.
- [MacTeX][], a LaTeX distribution for macOS.
- [VirtualBox][] to run VMs, mostly for development. Some people prefer VMware.
- [Textual][], awesome IRC client.
- [Texpad][], awesome LaTeX editor.
- [Sublime Text][], awesome programmer's text editor.

Additionally, I also installed a couple of apps that are not strictly necessary, but I still use them occasionally.

- [Git Up][], a GUI for interacting with *git* repositories.
- [VLC][], the famous media player that can play *anything*.
- [Transmission][], awesome Torrent client.
- [OpenEmu][], for playing those old Mario games.

Instead of using the awesome Shimo app, I opted for using the native IKEv2 support in macOS to set up some of my VPNs. It is always useful to have a few in case you are forced to use a questionable public WiFi. I probably will need to set up Shimo anyways to access my university's VPN at some point in time.

Out-of-the box, macOS has a bunch of great things already, but some of the tools it ships with are out-of-date.

- [git][] version control system. I keep a lot of things under [git]{.acr} control, such as this blog.
- [vim][], the ubiquitous editor. My go-to editor for a lot of things. Ships out-of-the-box on macOS (thank you Apple!), but with an outdated version. Some people prefer the newer [NeoVim][], others like Emacs and some people don't like any command-line text-editors.
- tmux
- [ruby][], my favourite programming language. Also ships out-of-the-box on macOS, but with an outdated version.
- [rust][], Mozilla's fancy-pants new language. 

## Dash

Dash is an offline documentation browser. That means that it has a catalog of documentation for various programming languages, frameworks, *gems*, *pods*, tools, etc. These are called *docsets*. Most docsets are official and autogenerated or maintained by the author, but there are also plenty of user-contributed ones. The format is open, such that you can create your own docsets. There are also a bunch of Dash clones for other platforms that use them, such as [Zeal][] on Linux or [Velocity][] on Microsoft Windows.

I love Dash because the interface is well-designed. For example if you want to find out something about the Ruby *Array#join* method, you try `ruby: Array join` into the search field. I find that using Dash is far more effective that googling for things, and you can explore classes and find out what methods they have. The docsets are really good and auto-update, which is important for languages like Rust that have new releases often.

Another interesting feature is that Dash can download all [StackOverflow][] answers that are tagged to a specific programming language or framework. This can sometimes be useful if you can't figure out from the documentation how things fit together, but I don't use that feature much.

I bought a license back in 2015 for around 28€ (about $30). That license still works on Dash 4, which was released in 2017.
